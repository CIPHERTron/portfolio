            <p>
              Hello! This is Pritish Samal, a prefinal year student from National Institute of
              Technology, Rourkela ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ majoring in Ceramic Engineering. I'm a Full Stack Developer
              having experience in MERN Stack, Flask and frameworks like Nextjs & Gatsby. I'm also a
              huge cloud & open-source enthusiast who believes in the power of community. Writing
              clean code is and will always be a top priority for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              The recent outbreak of the global pandemic, which led to the lockdown, has made me a
              typical computer nerd. So, you'll rarely find me AFK. When I'm not coding, I'll be
              busy organising or participating in Hackathons, involved in community programs,
              hosting or attending seminars & workshops, writing blogs and solving doubt & mentoring
              students. I also love outdoor sports like football & basketball and have a knack of
              mobile photography.
