## Poetry is a dependency management tool with the help of which we can add or remove or update dependencies.
- Initializing a poetry project will create a pyproject.toml and poetry.lock. We'll have all our dependencies listed on pyproject.toml whereas poetry.lock tracks the addition and removal of dependencies. Similarly, you can configure how poetry works with the help of poetry.toml.
- Another amazing functionality of Poetry is that it takes care of your virtual environments. You just have to spawn a shell using `poetry shell` which will create a virtual env and activate it automatically.
