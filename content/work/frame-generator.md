This is a Digital Profile Frame Generator built with React, TypeScript, CSS & Firebase. We have used cloudinary to store images. Basically, here you can add your picture, zoom & crop it according to your choice. There's also a text box where you can write your name & details which will get printed on the frame. You can also apply filters. As of now, there's only grayscale filter. We plan to add even more filters to this project. Then, at the end you can click on the download button to download your digital frame.

You can also upload your custom frame along with some other dimension details. Once we approve it, you can see your frame in the frame carousel. Some example Profile Frames are listed below:
