### **The problem PROJECT-OSHA solves**

While social distancing is the key to protect ourselves from becoming covid positive, it would really be difficult to stand in queues and wait for hours to just get an appointment from our doctor in the post covid era.

Carrying our medical reports everywhere, from one doctor to another might be a tedious job and sometimes, we lose our important records. It really becomes important for a doctor to know our medical history before medication and not having proper documents might become a life threat.

We present to you OSHA a one-stop solution for all these problems. You can signup on our web app as a doctor or a patient. While on the signup page, you can locate nearby hospitals and pharmaceuticals in emergency and make an emergency call as well. As you log in, you can see an option to book an appointment with the doctor. Also, you can store all your previous medical reports here so that you won't have to carry them everywhere.

Looking at a broader spectrum, we have designed this app in such a way that a disabled person can use ASL->text conversion for conveying his problem to the doctor. (ASL ie American Sign Language)

Suffering from an ailment might cause a lot of stress and affect one's mental health, hence we have also incorporated a mental health chatbot-XORI as a companion to the user.

We also have a 3D fitness assistant and a doctor to assist you in your mental and physical well-being, made using EchoAR. The fitness assistant will show you some workouts which will help you in staying fit.
