> **Tech Stack**: React, Node, Express, Mongo DB, Material UI

_This is the admin panel for the employees of a Restaurant to manage their day to day works through this website. Here, the user can Login, view fill levels of the containers present, items stack which includes the clean and dirty utensils, place and track an order, alert notifications, ingredients usage & hardware statistics._

I did this as a part of the **Humaps Organization, Bhubaneswar, Odisha** where I worked on developing the user interface using React JS and Material UI. Also, I used Express JS for the backend & Mongo DB as the database. The repository is private, thus you can't see the codebase. However, I've added a demo video which shows all the features in a nutshell.
